## Docker Backend

To run the backend, use the command associate yarn docker command:

```sh
# Build the container
yarn buildLocalDevDocker
# Run the container
yarn startLocalDevDocker
```

The container will be started with a database with fresh data.

## Troubleshooting

To use mongo, you need to run in your terminal:

```
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
```

## How to reuse LABEL

### Philosophy

LABEL has been designed to be reused whatever the annotation context. There are two different kinds of packages in LABEL

- specific: what is specific to the Cour de cassation (machine learning engine API, database connector, etc.)
- generic: what is not linked to the specific needs of the Cour de cassation

### Add documents you want to annotate

The `courDeCassation/storage-example` contains two folders:

- documents : the documents you want to annotate. Look at `courDeCassation/storage-example/documents/123452.json` for an example of the fields you are supposed to fill. The only required fields are:
  - `dateDecision`: the date of the document
  - `originalText`: the text of the document. Every paragraph has to be separated by \n
  - `sourceId`: the unique ID of the document, which must also be its name ("{ID}.json")
- annotations: the initial annotations for a document. If you don't have an automatic annotator, copy/paste the `courDeCassation/storage-example/annotations/123452.json` content.

The folder used by LABEL is `courDeCassation/storage`. If you want to reuse the `storage-example` folder as is, simply rename it to `storage`.

### Edit the annotation settings

- Open the `packages/courDeCassation/settings`
- Edit the file, for each category:
  - `anonymization`: text with which the annotated text is replaced. %c / %d are respectively iterating letters / numbers
  - `color`:
    - `darkMode`: color of the category when in dark mode. The available colors are the [shades of MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/customization/color/#color-palette)
    - `lightMode`: color of the category when in light mode. The available colors are the [shades of MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/customization/color/#color-palette)
  - `iconName`: the icon name in the `packages/generic/client/src/components/generic/materialUI/Icon.tsx` file. All the used icons are Material UI.
  - `order`: order the category is displayed in the annotator interface
  - `text`: name of the category displayed in the annotator interfaces

### Run the project

Run in two different terminals:

- yarn dockerBackendBuild && yarn dockerBackendStart
- yarn startLocalClientDev

Then, on your web browser, open http://localhost:55432
